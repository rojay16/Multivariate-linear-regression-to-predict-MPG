## Multivariate linear regression to predict MPG of cars

The report generated from the markdown file uses multivariate linear regression to determine what factors (such as weight or transmission) effect the mpg of a car.
The data is taken from the mtcars dataset in R. This report demonstrates the use of multivariate regression in R, incoprating factor variables in regression,
use of ggplot in R as well as how the interpret the results of the regression through the undertanding of the slopes, intercepts and their signifigance based on p-values.
